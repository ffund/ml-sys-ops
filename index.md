# ECE-GY 9183 Machine Learning Systems Engineering and Operations - Spring 2025

_Fraida Fund_ 

**Description**: Building deployable, reliable, and scalable machine learning systems involves a lot more than just training a model. In this graduate course on machine learning systems engineering and machine learning operations (MLOps), students will learn techniques for designing, developing, evaluating, deploying, monitoring, and updating production-ready machine learning systems at scale. 

**Instructor**: Fraida Fund (ffund@nyu.edu) (370 Jay St, Room 936). The best way to reach me is to post on Ed or to visit my office hour (see Brightspace calendar for dates and Zoom links).

**Instruction mode**: In person. We will meet on Thursdays at 2PM in 370 Jay Street, Room 202.

**Prerequisites**: ECE-GY 6143 Intro ML or equivalent.

**Approach**: students will learn through a combination of lectures, case studies, guided lab assignments on the [ChameleonCloud](https://chameleoncloud.org/) research infrastructure and on commercial clouds (GCP, AWS), and a final project.

**Grading**: 60% lab assignments; 40% final project

**Relationship to other ECE courses**: Although only Intro ML is required as a prerequisite, this course will complement existing ECE courses at NYU Tandon (for students who have taken/will take them), including 

* ML courses such as ECE-GY 6143 Intro to Machine Learning, ECE-GY 7123 Deep Learning, and ECE-GY 9143 Intro to High Performance Machine Learning
* and networking/systems courses such as ECE-GY 6353 Internet Architecture and Protocols and ECE-GY 6363 Data Center and Cloud Computing.

Prior/future experience in any of the above is helpful, although not necessary (except for Intro ML). Students will gain a big-picture view and hands-on experience integrating concepts from all of these courses into the development of a production-ready machine learning system. 

**Topics**: This course will cover the following topics (tentative plan/subject to change):

1. Challenges and basic principles of machine learning systems engineering and operations.
2. Overview of cloud computing.
3. DevOps and continuous X for ML systems (integration, training, deployment, testing, monitoring).
4. Model training at scale.
5. Model tuning and scheduling.
5. Versioning and reproducibility.
6. Model serving.
7. Monitoring and evaluating ML systems.
8. Large scale data systems.
9. Using commercial clouds (GCP, AWS).

The remaining lecture sessions will be used for case studies, additional topics, and project presentations.

**Time commitment**: This is a 3-credit course. The average student should spend at least 3 hours/week/credit â†’ 9 hours/week for a 3 credit course. A typical week will include:

- lecture: 2-2.5 hours
- reading for additional depth (case study/academic paper): 1 hour
- lab assignment: 4-5 hours

as well as some time for project development and implementation. (Toward the end of the semester, the lab workload will decrease somewhat to allow more time for project work.) A student who is not very comfortable with computer systems may have to spend more time than the estimate above in order to do well.
