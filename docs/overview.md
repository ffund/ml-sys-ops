# Overview

This table will be updated weekly with links to course materials (lecture handouts, lab manuals) as we progress through the course.

<table><thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Week</th>
    <th>Lecture material</th>
    <th>Other material</th>
    <th>Deadlines</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>ML systems</td>
    <td>Lab material:
        <ul>
            <li>Hello, Chameleon</li>
            <li>Hello, Linux</li>
        </ul>
        (If you have done these already in a previous course, you will just need to join the project for this course, and make sure you can still access the keys associate with your Chameleon profile.)
